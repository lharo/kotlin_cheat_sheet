A list is an ordered collection of items. In Kotlin,
lists can be either mutable (MutableList) or read-only (List).
For list creation, use the standard library functions listOf()
for read-only lists and mutableListOf() for mutable lists.
To prevent unwanted modifications, obtain read-only views of mutable lists by casting them to List.
